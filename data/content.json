We understand that true reconciliation to God is the process of having an intimate and loving relationship with our Creator. During this process a nurturing relationship is formed, and we find our hope, peace, love, fulfillment, and joy in Him. We believe this is our foundational relationship that hinges the success of all other relationships.",
      "description2": "We agree with Peter when he said, \"Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth,\" having Jesus is better than having silver or gold. Maintaining this relationship revolutionizes our entire lives. Holy City is dedicated to the personal success of every member. We are committed to reach beyond carnal limitations and inherit the promise of eternal life; therefore, all of our efforts are focused and directed towards this purpose.",
